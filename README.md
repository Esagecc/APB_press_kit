I completed the fourth press kit for Robert Fusion film. It was completed from the Jason Z template. I omitted the background images and change the color of the elements. 

I still need to update the links of social icon of the cast and crew. It was fun to add the press kit due to the APB film was already nominated in a film fest within a month of applying.

I completed the press kit with cast and crew social icons. I uploaded the site to github and got a qr codes to share. 

Note to self: at the beginning of a movie request the following to all cast and crew: photo shot, all social account links, and short bios. Say it part of the press kit.
